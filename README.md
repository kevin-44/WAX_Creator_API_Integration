# Overview

The [WAX Creator API](https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange/wax-creator) allows developers to create [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) (WAX Collectible Cards, WAX Stickers & WAX Digital Art) on the WAX Blockchain for free via external sources. NFTs must be approved by the [OPSkins support team](https://opskins.com/?loc=support_tickets), before minted on the WAX Blockchain, and sent to the issuer's [WAX Trade Inventory](https://trade.wax.io/inventory). A NFT can be `Verified Authentic`, meaning proof of ownership can be provided for that NFT. `Verified Authentic` NFTs can be assigned an instant-sell value. Additionally, NFTs can be assigned `Attributes`. This can be useful for card games, for example.

> **Note**: Submitting `Verified Authentic` NFTs take longer to be approved than non-`Verified Authentic` NFTs. However, these show as `Verified Authentic` on WAX Trade and OPSkins.
